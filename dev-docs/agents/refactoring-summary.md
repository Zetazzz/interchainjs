# Refactoring Summary - Remove requests.ts and responses.ts

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Removed Single Type Files ✓
- Deleted `networks/cosmos/src/types/requests.ts`
- Deleted `networks/cosmos/src/types/responses.ts`

### 2. Updated All Imports ✓
All imports have been updated from single files to folder structure:
- From: `../types/requests.ts` → To: `../types/requests/...`
- From: `../types/responses.ts` → To: `../types/responses/...`

Files updated:
- `src/query/cosmos-query-client.ts`
- `src/query/cosmos-event-client.ts`
- `src/adapters/base.ts`
- `src/query/__tests__/broadcast.test.ts`
- `src/adapters/__tests__/tendermint-broadcast.test.ts`

### 3. Created Missing Types ✓
Created event types that were missing:
- `/types/responses/common/event/tx-event.ts`
- `/types/responses/common/event/block-event.ts`
- `/types/responses/common/event/index.ts`

### 4. Fixed Type Issues ✓
- Removed duplicate `CheckTxResponse` type (kept the one in `common/tx`)
- Added missing `EventAttribute` export
- Updated `BroadcastTxSyncResponse` to include all expected fields (info, events, codespace)

### 5. Build Status ✓
- The entire project builds successfully with `yarn build`
- No TypeScript errors in the cosmos package

### 6. Dummy Types ✓
- All dummy types have been removed
- No references to `DummyRequest` or `DummyResponse` remain

## Notes on `any` Types

There are some `any` types remaining in consensus state structures:
- `src/types/responses/common/consensus-state/round-state.ts`
- `src/types/responses/common/consensus-state/peer-round-state.ts`

These appear to be intentional as they represent complex structures that are passed through without conversion. The codec simply uses `(value: unknown) => value` for these fields.

## Test Status

Tests are failing due to missing dependencies in the test environment (`@interchainjs/encoding`, `@interchainjs/types`), not due to issues with the refactoring itself.

## Conclusion

The main refactoring task has been completed successfully:
- ✓ Removed `requests.ts` and `responses.ts` files
- ✓ Updated all imports to use folder structure
- ✓ Project builds successfully
- ✓ No dummy types remaining
- ✓ All types properly migrated to folder structure
