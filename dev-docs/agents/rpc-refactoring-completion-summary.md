# RPC Method Refactoring Completion Summary

## Date: 2025-07-12

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion status of RPC method refactoring for the interchainjs-query project under networks/cosmos, following the guidelines in `dev-docs/agents/queries/rpc-method-refactoring-guide.md`.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Build Issues
- **Issue**: Missing exports causing build errors
- **Resolution**: 
  - Added missing exports to `/types/responses/common/index.ts` (added 'event' and 'unconfirmed-txs')
  - Added missing exports to `/types/requests/index.ts` (added 'block' and 'tx')

### 2. Resolved Naming Conflicts
- **Issue**: `BlockParams` type existed in both request and response contexts
  - Request: `/types/requests/common/block/block-params.ts` - Parameters for block queries
  - Response: `/types/responses/common/consensus-params/block-params.ts` - Nested type within ConsensusParams
- **Resolution**: Modified `/types/responses/common/consensus-params/index.ts` to only export main response types, not nested parameter types, avoiding naming conflicts

### 3. Verified Refactoring Completion
- All methods in `cosmos-query-client.ts` have been refactored to use specific encoder/decoder methods
- No more usage of generic `encodeParams` and `decodeResponse` in the query client
- All decoder methods properly use generics as specified in the guide: `decodeMethodName<T extends ResponseType = ResponseType>(response: unknown): T`

## Current State

### Build Status
- ✅ Project builds successfully without errors
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly

### Code Quality
- ✅ No usage of 'any' types in refactored code (except where necessary in base adapter for generic handling)
- ✅ Proper type safety maintained throughout
- ✅ Nested types are reused appropriately
- ✅ Generic types used for decoder flexibility

### All Refactored Methods (Verified)

- ✅ getAbciInfo
- ✅ queryAbci
- ✅ getBlock
- ✅ getBlockByHash
- ✅ getBlockResults

```

### 2. Adapter Pattern
- `BaseAdapter` implements common encoding/decoding logic
- Version-specific adapters (v0_34, v0_37, v0_38) extend base functionality
- Each method has its own encoder/decoder pair
- Decoders use generic types for flexibility

### 3. Codec Pattern
- All types use `createCodec()` for consistent encoding/decoding
- Proper converters for numeric fields, BigInt, arrays, etc.
- Nested types are properly handled with their own create functions

## Remaining Considerations

### 1. Legacy Code
- `encodeParams` and `decodeResponse` methods still exist in `BaseAdapter` but are only used by the event client
- These should eventually be removed once the event client is refactored

### 2. Testing
- No test files found in the cosmos package
- Tests would need to be written to verify the refactored methods work correctly with real RPC responses

### 3. Documentation
- All refactored methods maintain their JSDoc comments
- Type definitions are clear and self-documenting

## Conclusion

The RPC method refactoring for the cosmos network package has been successfully completed. All methods now use the new pattern with specific encoders and decoders, proper type safety is maintained throughout, and the project builds without errors. The refactoring follows all guidelines specified in the refactoring guide and maintains backward compatibility where needed.
